## USING THIS TEMPLATE:

- Make sure to run npm install

- View engine is express-vue: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-vue

- Environmental variables defined in env.yaml, so create a env.yaml that looks like this...

```yaml
development:
  PORT: 4000
  SECRET: "production"

production:
  PORT: 3000
  SECRET: "development"
```

## Commands

`npm run dev` run dev server look for env.yaml for environmental variables

`npm run start` run in production more, not look for env.yaml

- For production you should add a store property to sessions that'll store the session in redis or mongo. See the express-session documentation to learn more.
